  title: What Is It?
  description: >
    At envdeck we give you the ability to spin up, distribute and manage
    developer environments for your whole team, in the cloud.  Giving them the
    ability to work on any machine with an internet connection, securely and
    easily, and saves management the financial burden of costly hardware or IT
    services.
description: With your developers all working on cloud-based machines, you can
  be sure of no more "it works on my machine" issues holding up productivity.

        A cloud-based developer environment is designed to do one thing, run
        your code.  No resource-hogging background programs like slack or chrome
        will slow your developers down.  With your developer's all working in
        the same environments, machine-specific issues are a thing of the past,
        letting your developers work on the code that matters, yours.

        Manage all your environments in one easy-to-use dashboard, give each
        developer as many as they need to get their job done.  Manage your team,
        invite new members, revoke access to others and see what your team has
        running at any given time.

        With code no longer sitting on your developer's macbook's, you can be
        sure that should the worst happen, you can simply revoke their access
        and your business-critical code will remain secure.  This saves money on
        costly IT services installing unstable security software on all your
        company's hardware.  Hire remote teams or freelancers with
        peace-of-mind.

        Your developers can spin-up our browser-based IDE, theia, which is an
        open-source version of the immensely popular VScode, at a click of a
        button, and work from anywhere with an internet connection.  No more
        need to pay for best-in-class hardware or expensive
        macbooks.   Databases and other commonly-used technologies can be added
        without worrying about installation, networking or other common set-up
        problems that drain time away from the productive work.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
